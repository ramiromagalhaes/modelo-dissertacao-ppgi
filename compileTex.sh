# Script used for compiling main.tex, a file created by: 
# lucasribeiro@ufrj.br / Federal University of Rio de Janeiro


# Instructions for compiling on linux( Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 ):
# 1) Open terminal ( crtl + alt + control )
# 2) Navegate to the folder where compileTex.sh is in using the command:
# $ cd <path-to-compileTex.sh>
# Where <path-to-compileTex.sh> could be ~/MyFiles/latex resulting in the command:
# $ cd ~/MyFiles/latex
# 3) Now that you are in folder where compileTex.sh resides, you must change the permission
# of the file, so that you can execute it. To do that you can use the command chmod. For example
# use like this:
# $ sudo chmod 777 compileTex.sh
# 4) Now you can run the script by doing this:
# $ ./compileTex.sh
# 5) The pdf generated will be at same folder as script file compileTex.sh (root folder)
# 
# Obs.: To clean up all files generated by latex, use the parameter clean as:
# $ ./compileTex.sh clean
